      My business idea is to create a unique cultural and healing music project that uses South Asian traditional music, dance, and storytelling to promote emotional healing, cultural understanding, and spiritual connection.
I offer live performances, interactive workshops, and wellness programs tailored for diverse audiences such as elderly care centers, schools, yoga studios, and community organizations in Sweden.
By blending multilingual singing, live instruments like tabla and harmonium, and expressive dance, I provide meaningful experiences that bridge cultures and foster joy, peace, and togetherness.
<br>
<br>
My company primarily targets Sri Lankans, South Asians, and individuals living in Sweden who are connected to or interested in South Asian music, culture, and spiritual healing. These include people seeking emotional connection, cultural identity, and inner peace through music rooted in tradition.
<br><br>
Building from that foundation, we also serve and collaborate with:
